Better Error Handling:
Show user-friendly error messages for network issues or invalid API responses.

Responsive Design:
Improve mobile and tablet layouts for a better user experience on all devices.

Search Suggestions/Autocomplete:
Suggest movie titles as the user types in the search bar.

Sort and Filter Watchlist:
Enable sorting (by title, rating, year) and filtering (by genre, type).

User Authentication:
Allow users to create accounts and save their watchlists to the cloud (optional, for advanced users).

Unit Tests:
Add basic tests for your JavaScript logic to ensure reliability.

Accessibility Improvements:
